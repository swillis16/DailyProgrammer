Sum Them Digits:

* As a crude form of hashing function, Lars wants to sum the digits of a number. Then he wants to sum the digits of the result, and repeat until he have only one digit left. He learnt that this is called the digital root of a number, but the Wikipedia article is just confusing him. Can you help him implement this problem in your favourite programming language?


Words With Ordered Vowels:

* Find words in a word list that contain all the vowels in alphabetical order, non-repeated, where vowels are defined as A E I O U Y.

New-Line Troubles:

* Your goal is to read ASCII-encoding text files and "fix" them for the encoding you want. You may be given a Windows-style text file that you want to convert to UNIX-style, or vice-versa.

* The following runs your program with the two arguments in the required quoted-strings.

./your_program.exe "/Users/nint22/WindowsFile.txt" "Unix"
